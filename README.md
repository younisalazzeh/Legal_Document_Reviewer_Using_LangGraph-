## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **LangGraph Workflow**
The application uses LangGraph to create a structured, step-by-step analysis workflow:

```
Document Upload ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Flag Risks ‚Üí Generate Questions ‚Üí Rewrite Clauses ‚Üí Results
```

#### 2. **State Management**
```python
class ReviewState(TypedDict):
    document_text: str
    document_type: str
    summary: str
    risk_flags: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    lawyer_questions: List[str]
    plain_english_clauses: List[Dict[str, str]]
    current_step: str
    error: str
```

#### 3. **Document Processing**
- **PDF Processing**: Uses PyPDF2 for text extraction
- **DOCX Processing**: Uses python-docx for Word document parsing
- **TXT Processing**: Direct UTF-8 text reading

#### 4. **AI Agent System**
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent analysis
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for each analysis step
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management throughout workflow

### Workflow Steps Explained

#### Step 1: Document Summarization

- **Output**: Structured summary including parties, terms, dates, obligations
- **Prompt Strategy**: Uses template-based prompting for consistent results

#### Step 2: Risk Analysis
- **Purpose**: Identify potential legal risks and red flags
- **Output**: Categorized risks with severity levels and recommendations
- **Risk Categories**: Financial, liability, compliance, termination, etc.
- **Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

#### Step 3: Lawyer Questions Generation
- **Purpose**: Create actionable questions for legal consultation
- **Focus Areas**: Ambiguous terms, risky clauses, negotiation opportunities
- **Output**: 8-12 specific, targeted questions

#### Step 4: Plain English Rewriting
- **Purpose**: Make complex legal language accessible
- **Process**: Identifies complex clauses and provides simplified explanations
- **Output**: Original text, plain English version, practical meaning

## üîß Customization Options

### Modifying AI Model Settings

In the `Config` class, you can adjust:
```python
class Config:
    OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4"  # Change to gpt-3.5-turbo for faster/cheaper analysis
    TEMPERATURE = 0.1     # Adjust creativity vs consistency
```

### Adding New Analysis Steps

To add a new step to the workflow:

1. **Create the analysis function**:
```python
def _new_analysis_step(self, state: ReviewState) -> ReviewState:
    # Your analysis logic here
    return state
```

2. **Update the graph**:
```python
workflow.add_node("new_step", self._new_analysis_step)
workflow.add_edge("previous_step", "new_step")
```

3. **Update the state**:
```python
class ReviewState(TypedDict):
    # Add new fields for your analysis
    new_field: List[str]
```

### Customizing Risk Categories

Modify the risk flagging prompt to focus on specific areas:
- Add industry-specific risks
- Customize severity thresholds
- Include regulatory compliance checks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "OpenAI API key not found"
- Ensure your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
- Check that the environment variable is loaded
- Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

#### "Error reading PDF/DOCX"
- Ensure the file is not password-protected
- Try converting to a different format
- Check file size (very large files may timeout)

#### "Analysis taking too long"
- Large documents may take several minutes
- Consider using gpt-3.5-turbo for faster processing
- Break very large documents into sections

#### "JSON parsing errors"
- The AI occasionally returns malformed JSON
- The application includes error handling for this
- Retry the analysis if errors persist

### Performance Tips

1. **Document Size**: Optimal performance with documents under 50 pages
2. **Model Selection**: Use GPT-3.5-turbo for faster processing, GPT-4 for better accuracy
3. **API Rate Limits**: Be aware of OpenAI's rate limiting for your tier
